Dodgy Plane: Privacy policy
Welcome to the Dodgy Plane Game for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Apolitic Games. The app is available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data created by save files stored on your device only,
also the app uses UNITY ADDS for monitization. Any data collected or used is directly between the Unity Adds system and the user. We do not gather any information from the user.
and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Apolitic Games.
